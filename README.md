## Statement of the Problem

Many people struggle to find reliable and well-organized exercise routines tailored to specific body parts. Additionally, while written instructions are helpful, visual demonstrations can significantly improve the understanding and execution of exercises. 

## Overview

This project addresses the problem by creating an online catalog of exercises, where users can easily browse exercises categorized by the body part they want to target. Each exercise is accompanied by a GIF to help users understand the correct form and technique.

## Features

- **Grouped by Body Part**: Exercises are categorized based on the body part they target (e.g., Arms, Legs, Back).
- **Visual Guidance**: Each exercise includes a GIF that demonstrates the correct form and technique.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Users can easily browse and filter exercises by body part.
